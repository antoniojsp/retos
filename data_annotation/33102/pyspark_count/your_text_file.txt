Task : Implement a word count algorithm using MapReduce to count the number of times each word
appears in a document.

Steps to take :

Step 1: Obtain a text document that you want to perform word count on. This can be a plain text file
or a dataset in a suitable format.
Step 2: Implement a MapReduce program to count the number of times each word appears in the
document. This program should consist of:
• A Mapper function that tokenizes the text, emits key-value pairs (word, 1) for each
word.
• A Reducer function that receives key-value pairs, groups them by key (word), and
sums up the values to get the word count.
