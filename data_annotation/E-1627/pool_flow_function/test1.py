# Step 1: Define the total amount of water needed
total_water_needed = 20000  # gallons

# Step 2: Calculate the time required
def calculate_time_required(total_water_needed):
    # Integrate the flow rate function with respect to time
    # The integral of f(t) = t is (t^2)/2
    # Set up an equation using the integral of the flow rate function and solve for t
    # (t^2)/2 = total_water_needed
    # t^2 = 2 * total_water_needed
    # t = sqrt(2 * total_water_needed)
    time_required = math.sqrt(2 * total_water_needed)
    return time_required

# Step 3: Solve for t
time_required = calculate_time_required(total_water_needed)
