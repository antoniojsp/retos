                Form SSA-3105 (12-2017)
                Reconsideration
                If you request Reconsideration, the overpayment decision will be reviewed by a Social Security
                employee who did not participate in the original overpayment decision.
                If you request Reconsideration within 30 days from the date of this notice, we will not start
                to withhold any part of your benefits. However, after 30 days we will start to withhold part or all of your benefits.
                If you request Reconsideration within 60 days from the date of this notice, we will suspend any
                withholding while the overpayment decision is being reviewed. Also, if we asked you to refund the overpayment,
                you will not have to make any refund while the overpayment decision is being reviewed.
                If you do not appeal within the 60 day time limit, you may lose your right to this appeal.
                If you have a good reason (such as hospitalization) for not appealing within the time limits, we may give you more time.
                 A request for more time must be made to us in writing, stating the reason for the delay.


                Waiver
                If you request Waiver of recovery of the overpayment and your request is approved, you will not have to repay the overpayment.
                We will approve your waiver request if:

                    The overpayment was not your fault and repaying it would mean you could not pay your necessary living expenses, OR
                    The overpayment was not your fault and repaying it would be unfair to you.

                There is no time limit on your right to request waiver.
                If you request Waiver within 30 days from the date of this notice, we will not start withholding any part of your benefits.
                If you request Waiver after 30 days, we will suspend any withholding while we consider your Waiver request.
                If we asked you to refund the overpayment, you will not have to make any refund while your waiver request is being considered.
                If we cannot approve your Waiver request, we will contact you to schedule a Personal Conference.
                At that conference, you or your representative may explain why you should not have to repay the overpayment.
                Also, you or your representative may present witnesses on your behalf and,
                if you wish, question any witnesses that we used in making the determination being reviewed.
                We will notify you in writing of the result of your Waiver request, and whether you must repay the overpayment.
                That notice will explain your right to appeal. If you do not want a Personal Conference, you still have the right to appeal.
                We will notify you of other appeal rights.
                BE SURE TO CALL THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION AT 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778) IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS




                 I am requesting a Reconsideration (I disagree with the amount of the overpayment or the fact that I was overpaid).
                 I am requesting a Waiver (the overpayment was not my fault and I cannot afford to repay).
                 I am requesting both Reconsideration and Waiver.
                 I want $1,499 withheld from my monthly Social Security check to repay the overpayment.
                 I am no longer receiving benefits and want to repay the overpayment in monthly installments.
                 Enclosed is my first refund of $1000.
                 I am requesting an explanation of the overpayment.
                 Other (Please explain on a separate sheet of paper).
